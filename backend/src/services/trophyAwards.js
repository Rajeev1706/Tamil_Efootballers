// Correction-safe trophy awarding. Unlike bdrAwards.js's claimAward() (which
// fires once and never again — so it can't fix a wrong result after the
// fact), this is designed to be called EVERY time a competition completes,
// including when an admin corrects an earlier result. It always converges
// to the currently-correct set of holders for a given event:
//
//   - First call for a sourceKey       -> awards everyone in playerIds
//   - Same set called again            -> no-op, already correct
//   - Different set (partial or total) -> reverts whoever should no longer
//                                          hold it, awards whoever newly
//                                          should, leaves unchanged anyone
//                                          correct on both sides
//
// A single "winner" (UCL/Weekly champion or golden boot) is just a roster
// of size one — pass playerIds: [winnerId] (or [] for "no valid winner").
// A team trophy (Team League) passes the whole winning roster's player IDs.
//
// sourceKey must uniquely identify the real-world event (e.g.
// "ucl_champion_tournament_5"), NOT the trophy type alone — that's what
// makes one specific Final/season/tournament individually correctable
// without touching any other award.
