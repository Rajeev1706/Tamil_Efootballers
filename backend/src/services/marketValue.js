/**
 * marketValue.js — single source of truth for calculating a player's market value.
 *
 * This replaces reliance on the DB's compute_market_value() SQL function. That
 * function still exists and its trigger still fires automatically on
 * match_records changes, but every code path below explicitly overwrites
 * whatever the trigger set, so the SQL function's output is never the final
 * answer — this file's calculateMarketValue() is. This means changing the
 * formula only ever requires editing this file — never a DB migration or
 * manual SQL. (NOTE: as of this version, the SQL trigger's own formula was
 * NOT updated to match this file's draw/loss matrix, season-scoping, or
 * trophy bonuses — it's still on the older simple table. Since its output is
 * always overwritten before it's ever read, this has no user-visible effect,
 * but flagging it in case it ever needs to be brought back in sync.)
 *
 * Formula — EVERYTHING here is scoped to the CURRENT season only (matches,
 * BDR points, and trophies alike), so "Start New Season" genuinely gives
 * every player a clean slate across the whole formula, not just part of it:
 *   1. WIN value depends only on the opponent's grade (unchanged — beating a
 *      tougher opponent is worth more, regardless of your own grade).
 *   2. DRAW and LOSS values depend on BOTH the player's own grade AND the
 *      opponent's grade (a full grade x grade matrix, see below).
 *   3. Only match_records from the CURRENT season_number count at all.
 *   4. ew scales directly with the summed weighted total (ewRaw), uncapped.
 *   5. pp = ew * 3, winPct = ew / 14 (scaling reference only)
 *   6. matchValue = min(pp * 5 + winPct * 85, MATCH_VALUE_CEILING) — the
 *      match-performance component alone is capped at 450.
 *   7. BDR swing — scaled by the player's current bdr_points (itself already
 *      reset to 0 on a season reset), uncapped, only applies once the player
 *      has a positive effective-win score this season (ewRaw > 0).
 *   8. mvRaw = matchValue + bdrSwing
 *   9. Base value = max(50, round to nearest 5) — but ONLY if the player has
 *      played at least one match THIS season. Zero matches this season ->
 *      market value is 0, a genuine fresh start, regardless of past seasons.
 *  10. Trophy bonus — added ON TOP of the base value, from trophies won
 *      THIS season only (player_trophies, season-scoped) — the lifetime
 *      trophy1Count..trophy7Count columns never affect this, they're purely
 *      the career Trophy Case display.
 *  11. Final value = base value + trophy bonus.
